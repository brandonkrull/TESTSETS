scripts to set up and run test sets can be found in ./setupfiles/

Scripts to scan the percentage of exact exchange (runTESTSET.slurm.scan,
scan.py, slurm.dscf.scan) can only be used with a modified version of
Turbomole, where the percentage of exact exchange is epecified in
the $acgga keyword in the control file.
